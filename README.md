# dotty

`dotty` is a simple-to-use config and dotfiles manager with profile support, written in C++23

## Features

- **Simple Configuration**: Use a straightforward syntax to map source files to their destinations.
- **Profile Management**: Supports multiple configuration profiles (e.g., `main`, `wm`, `terminal`).
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates & synces a GitHub repository for your dotfiles

## Prerequisites

Before building and using `dotty`, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Dependencies**:
  - [xmake] (https://xmake.io/) - Dotty's build tool
  - [github-cli] (https://cli.github.com/) For repository management
  - [CLI11] (https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) For command line parsing
  - [readline] (https://github.com/JuliaAttic/readline) For user input
  - [bat] (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) For file logging

## Installation

### Dotty is available in AUR
```bash
yay -S dotty
```
OR, if you use paru:
```bash
paru -S dotty
```


### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Monjaris/dotty.git
   cd dotty
   ```

2. Build dotty using xmake:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Install the binary:
   ```bash
   xmake install
   ```



## Usage


### 1. Initialization

To set up `dotty` for the first time:

```bash
dotty init
```

This command will:
- Check for GitHub authentication.
- Prompt for a repository name and visibility.
- Initialize a local git repository in `~/.local/share/dotty/<profile-name>`.
- Create a corresponding repository on GitHub and push the initial commit.


### 2. Configuration

`dotty` looks for configuration in `~/.config/dotty/<profile>/config`. 

The configuration file uses a simple mapping syntax:
```
"/path/to/source/file" >> "relative/path/in/storage"
```


Example:
```
"~/.bashrc" >> "shell/.bashrc"
"~/.config/nvim/init.lua" >> "nvim/" # delivers file name properly
```


### 3. Applying configs

To copy your local files into the `dotty` storage:


```bash
dotty update # dotty u
```

Push repo to github repository which was configuired
```bash
dotty push
```

Pull your configs and apply to system, to get them on another machine or for rollback
```bash
dotty pull
```

Dotty supports multiple profiles. to create one:
```bash
dotty profile new terminal-configs # dotty p n terminal-configs
```
You can switch between them
```bash
dotty profile switch main # dotty p s main
```

Or you can delete them
```bash
dotty profile delete terminal-configs # dotty p d terminal-configs
```

You can also directly open configuration instead of the manual way
```bash
dotty config
```
